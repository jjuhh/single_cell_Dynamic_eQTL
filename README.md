# single_cell_Dynamic_eQTL

We cultured lung epithelial organoids from normal lung tissue to investigate the effect of genotype on RNA expression. Changes in RNA expression level due to external factors were minimized by in vitro culture using the same media and under the same conditions. After dissociation of this organoids into a single cell, 10X Genomics' scRNA-seq was performed. Cell type specific eQTL can be found by combining scRNA-seq data and genotype data, and it can be found that the degree of eQTL varies according to lineage, called "Dynamic eQTL"
